# Bayes Factor Workshop videos

Here are the links to video recordings of Richard Morey's BayesFactor workshop held in Hobart on 15-Jun-2015:

Part 1 consists of two one-hour lectures (Hour 1: Basic philosophy and introduction to Bayesian inference; Hour 2: More specifics - from prior, through Bayes factors to posteriors)

Part 2 is a little more practical as it aims towards using the BayesFactor package in R: one hour of Bayes factor for linear models and one hour of using the BayesFactor package in R.

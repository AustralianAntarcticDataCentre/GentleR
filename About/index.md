# About 

GentleR is an R working group that gives users a chance to learn and practice their skills in the statistical language R on a frequent, ongoing basis. We meet 9-10:30am on Thursday each week in the AAD Science Tearoom. It is also a forum for discussing statistical problems - how to design experiments, collect data, and different approaches to the presentation and analysis of data - quite irrespective of the statistical software you might use. There are usually a couple of statisticians present, so approaches to particular problems can be varied and discussion lively. While solutions are couched in R, the theory, techniques, assumptions and pitfalls apply no matter what the software package.

A few things to note:  

- students affiliated with AAD staff are welcome, so please encourage them to attend  

- meetings with formal topics are advertised on the AAD Quantitative email list, so ask to be added to that list

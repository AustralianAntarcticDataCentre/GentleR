# About 

GentleR is an R working group that gives users a chance to learn and practice their skills in the statistical language R on a frequent, ongoing basis. It is also a forum for discussing statistical problems - how to design experiments, collect data, and different approaches to the presentation and analysis of data - quite irrespective of the statistical software you might use. There are usually a couple of statisticians present, so approaches to particular problems can be varied and discussion lively. While solutions are couched in R, the theory, techniques, assumptions and pitfalls apply no matter what the software package. Some points:

- We meet 9-10:30am on Thursday each week in the AAD Science Tearoom.
- Staff and students are encouraged to present their barely-started/ongoing/about-to-publish analysis work for gentle feedback. 
- If you have something you want to get advice about, you **can** just turn up on the day and put it on the table for informal advice.  
- There is an email list but it is **only** used for cancellations or advertising special events; meetings go ahead every week unless notified otherwise.
- Email me (JMcK) to ask to be added to the email distribution list.
- External attendees are picked up from AAD reception at 8:55 am sharp!   
- I will try to use the github page to give advance warning of informal discussion topics, but note I often don't know what these are ahead of time.
